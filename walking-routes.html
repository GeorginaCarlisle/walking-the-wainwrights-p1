                            reward you with experiencing the impressive Hobcarton Crag and spectacular views over the
                            North Western fells, back towards Derwentwater and Keswick and even across to the Solway Firth and

                            Beck back to Braithwaite. Or, add in other Wainwrights such as Whiteside, Grasmoor, Wandope,

                <p>Walking in the Lake District is a wonderful activity and is relatively safe. Hiking does, 
                    however, carry a risk of injury or worse. You should be aware of, and accept these risks, 
                    and be responsible for your actions.</p>

                            <p><strong>Plan your route in advance</strong>. Make sure you know what landscapes you will encounter
                                (steep, rocky, cliff edge, boggy), features to look for to ensure you stay on route, 
                                and how long you anticipate the walk to take (make sure to leave plenty of time). 
                                Plan alternative routes should you become tired or short on time.

                                is a website that provides an up to date weather forecast specific to walking in the Lake District. 
                                Check the forecast the day before you set off and again on the day of your walk. 
                                Conditions can change dramatically even in a short space of time. Avoid 
                                steep and exposed ground if storms and /or high winds are forecast. High rainfall can 
                                result in rivers becoming impassable and rocky ground slippery underfoot. All extremes 
                                of temperature can be hazardous. Always be prepared to turn back.
