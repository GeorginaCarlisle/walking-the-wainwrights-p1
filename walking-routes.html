                    <p>Ready to add in some height, some steep sections and some scrambles? If you are, then this walk will
                        reward you with experiencing the impressive Hobcarton Crag and spectacular views over the
                        North Western fells, back towards Derwentwater and Keswick and even across to the Solway Firth and 
                        Scotland on a clear day. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Make the walk your own</h4>
                    <p>Shorten the walk by descending back down after Hopegill Head via Force Crag Mine and along Coledale 
                        Beck back to Braithwaite. Or, add in other Wainwrights such as Whiteside, Grasmoor, Wandope, 
                        Whiteless Peak, Scar Crags or Causey Pike.</p>
