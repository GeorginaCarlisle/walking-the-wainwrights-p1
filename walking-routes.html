                <p>Walking in the Lake District is a wonderful activity and is relatively safe. Hiking does, 
                    however, carry a risk of injury or worse. You should be aware of, and accept these risks, 
                    and be responsible for your actions.</p>

                <p>The following tips will help you to stay safe and make your walk more enjoyable:</p>

                        <div class="list-item">

                            <span><strong>Plan your route in advance</strong>. Make sure you know what landscapes you will encounter
                            (steep, rocky, cliff edge, boggy), features to look for to ensure you stay on route, 
                            and how long you anticipate the walk to take (make sure to leave plenty of time). 
                            Plan alternative routes should you become tired or short on time.</span>

                            <span><strong>Check the weather</strong>. Check the forecast the day before you set off and again on the day 
                            of your walk. Conditions can change dramatically even in a short space of time. Avoid 
                            steep and exposed ground if storms and /or high winds are forecast. High rainfall can 
                            result in rivers becoming impassable and rocky ground slippery underfoot. All extremes 
                            of temperature can be hazardous. Always be prepared to turn back.</span>
