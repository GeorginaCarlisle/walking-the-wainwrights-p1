                    his article 'Why does Alfred Wainwright still loom large over the Lake District?' first published 
                    5 September 2021 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-57528980 -->
                    <p>More than 65 years since his first guidebook was published, and 30 years on from his death, Alfred Wainwright remains 
                        synonymous with the Lake District.</p>
                    <p>Donning his flat cap and beige coat, and with tobacco smoke rising gently from a pipe, Alfred Wainwright appeared far 
                        from your typical outdoor enthusiast. Even his behaviour, actively avoiding fellow walkers as he roamed the fells, 
                        was at odds with the conventional conduct of hiking. But having been raised in poverty amid the claustrophobia of 
                        Blackburn's cotton mills in the early 20th Century, the lakes and their wide-open vistas provided solace and a sense 
                        of wonder that captured his heart.</p>
                    <p>His fastidious pen-line drawings of more than 200 hills and mountains - alongside hand-written descriptions outlining 
                        the majesty of each - would stretch across seven volumes of his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells and sell more 
                        than two million copies. Following years of weekend bus journeys from his then-home in Kendal and fuelled by fish and chips from his favourite 
                        haunts, the books were his crowning achievement among the dozens of titles he had published.</p>
                    <!-- This final paragraph is my own text -->
                    <p>Like Wainwright, many people today find their hearts captured by the Lake District fells. In wanting to further explore 
                        the fells, Wainwright's books and the 214 fells described within provide focus and a goal to strive for. </p>

                    <p>‘It was a moment of magic, a revelation so unexpected that I stood transfixed, unable to believe my eyes. I saw mountain 
                        ranges, one after another, the nearer starkly etched, those beyond fading into the blue distance. Rich woodlands, emerald 
                        pastures and the shimmering waters of the lake below added to a pageant of loveliness, a glorious panorama that held me 
                        enthralled. I had seen landscapes of rural beauty pictured in the local art gallery, but here was no painted canvas; this 
                        was real. This was truth. God was in his heaven that day and I a humble worshipper.’
