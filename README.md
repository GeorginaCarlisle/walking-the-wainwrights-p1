## User Experience Design

### The Strategy Plane

The target user group for this website enjoy fell walking in the Lake District. They have heard of 'Wainwright' and some are aiming to summit all 214 of Wainwright's fells.

Value for the user will be provided through:
- Walking routes
- Information about the Wainwright fells
- Tips and stories from other fell walkers
- Information on looking after the fells
- Walking advice
- Information about the geography, geology and history of the fells

The value of this website to the owner will be in:
1 – Sharing their love for the Lake District Fells and in particular summiting the Wainwright fells.
2 – Informing and educating people who come to walk in the Lake District so that they know how to keep themselves safe and how to look after and preserve the fells.

Further strategy level considerations:
- High level user experience 
- Accessibility
- Responsiveness
