## User Experience Design

### The Strategy Plane

The primary target user group enjoy fell walking in the Lake District National Park and are specifically looking to summit some/all of 'The Wainwrights'. There is a secondary target user group who enjoy fell walking in the Lake District National Park and are looking at find out more about, and begin summiting 'The Wainwrigths'.

Value for the user (in order of importance)will be provided through:
- Walking routes that incorporate the Wainwrights
- Specific information about the Wainwright fells
- Information on looking after the fells
- Information about the geography, geology and history of the fells
- Tips and stories from other fell walkers
- Information about Alfred Wainwright
- Walking advice

Value for the owner of this website will be provided in:
1. Sharing their love for the Lake District Fells and in particular summiting the Wainwright fells.
2. Informing others how best to keep themsleves safe and look after the fells while out walking.
3. Providing support to others looking to summit the Wainwrights.

Position of site amongst competition:
- The proposed website would be unique as there are no current websites that bring together everything the target user group is looking for.
- With a high-level positive user experience this website would stand out from other websites which offer some of the same value.
- Prominently placing information about looking after the fells within this site
would be a big step in helping more fell walkers to become better aware of how to lessen their impact while out walking.

Further strategy level considerations:
- High level user experience 
- Accessibility
- Responsiveness

#### Development of the strategy plane

<!-- I used the following to learn how to create a dropdown: https://dev.to/asyraf/how-to-add-dropdown-in-markdown-o78  -->

<details>
<summary>Find out more about my process to develop the strategy plane and the research I undertook.</summary>

The following details are written in order of how I approached developing the strategy plane, showing how things evolved and changed.

#### Target Users

The primary target users are fairly new to fell walking in the Lake District. They may have heard the name ‘Wainwright’ and the concept of ‘The Wainwrights’ and want to learn more.

The secondary target users fall to either side of the above being either:
-	Completely new to walking in the Lake District and looking to head out on their first fell walk.
-	Keen fell walkers who are looking to specifically climb the Wainwright fells.

#### User Stories

USER A (primary target user)

Background: User A has visited the Lake District before or is a resident. They have done a little fell walking in the Lake District, probably one or two of the more well-known walks, have really enjoyed it and would like to do more. User A has not heard the name ‘Wainwright’.

Action: They search online to find out more about the Lake District fells and about fell walking in general. Possible key words/phrases they may search include: Lake District walks/mountains/fells, fell walking, mountain walking.

Required value:
1. Information about walking routes and fells to summit in the Lake District.
2. Detailed advice on fell walking (being prepared, staying safe and enjoying the walk)
3. Tips and stories from other people who enjoy walking in the Lake District.
4. Links to access more detailed information (other sites, maps, books)
5. They may also be interested in the geography, geology and history of the fells.

USER B (primary target user)

Background: User B like User A has done a little fell walking and is interested in doing more. User B though has heard the name ‘Wainwright’ and the concept of ‘The Wainwrights’
and would like to find out more.

Action: They search online to find out more about Wainwright (action and value described below) and fell walking in the Lake District (action and value is the same as user A and is described above). Possible key words/phrases they may search: Wainwright, Arthur Wainwright, the Wainwright fells/mountains/walks, the Wainwrights.

Required value:
1. Information about Arthur Wainwright. In particular: who he was and how he is linked to the fells of the Lake District.
2. Information about ‘The Wainwrights’. In particular: which fells are part of the Wainwrights and further information as to location, height and walking routes.
3. They may also be interested in the history of Wainwright’s life, the books he wrote and any further details.

USER C (secondary target user)

Background: User C is about to visit the Lake District (holiday/day trip) and is thinking about including fell walking as one of their holiday activities. 

Action: They follow links from sites they are already using to research their holiday or complete a Google search with the possible key words/phrases: walks/walking/fell walking in the Lake District, climbing Lake District mountains/fells, Lake District walks/mountains/fells.

Required value: 
1. Potential walks, including positive features, pictures from the walk, what to expect (what will they see, how hard, how far, how high, terrain), map/clear instructions and how to get to the start of the walk.
2. Advice, such as: what to pack, tips for an enjoyable walk and how to stay safe.
3. Walk reviews and tips from real people.

USER D (secondary target user)

Background: User D knows about Arthur Wainwright and ‘The Wainwrights’ and has decided they want to follow in his footsteps and complete some if not all the Wainwright fells.

Action: They search online with key words/phrases such as: Wainwright, Arthur Wainwright, the Wainwright fells, the Wainwrights.

Required value:
1. Specific Information about completing ‘The Wainwrights’. Including detailed information on all the Wainwright Fells.
2. Tips, advice and links to anything that might help them on their quest. This might include: detailed advice on fell walking (being prepared, staying safe and enjoying the walk), links to purchase Wainwright’s books and reviews on walking equipment.
3. Stories from or links into a community of walkers, like them, who are completing ‘The Wainwrights’.

#### Product Owner

The owner’s purpose in the creation of this website is to:
1. Share their love for the Lake District Fells and in particular climbing the Wainwright fells.
2. Inform and educate so that people who come to walk in the Lake District know how to keep themselves safe and how to look after and preserve the fells.

The value the owner is looking to achieve is an increase in the following amongst fell walkers in the Lake District:
1. Respect and love for the fells.
2. Specific knowledge and understanding of how to look after the fells – with an aim to end pollution (particularly rubbish), reduce disturbance of the flora and fauna of the fells and reduce erosion of the landscape.
3. Specific knowledge as to how to keep themselves safe while walking in the fells – with an aim to reduce the number of injuries, mountain rescue call outs and fatalities that occur.
4. Greater depth of knowledge about the Lake District Fells and Wainwright. 

#### Stakeholder

This website is being created for my portfolio project one, as part of my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. 
The purpose of the project is to:
-	‘Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity.’
-	‘Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages.’
-	‘Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform’.
-	‘Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation’.
-	‘Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub’.

(Note: The above quotes have been taken directly from the ‘Portfolio 1 Assessment Guide’ written by Code Institute)

The value to both myself (Georgina Carlisle) and Code Institute is:
-	 Fulfilment of the above criteria demonstrating characteristics of high-level performance.

#### Competitor Reviews

I undertook an online search using the key words from the user stories. For each relevant site found I then asked the following questions:
1. What required value might my primary and secondary users gain from the site?
2. What sort of user experience does the site provide?

Relevant websites looked at:

https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk
https://www.walklakes.co.uk
https://www.visitlakedistrict.com
https://www.lakedistricts.co.uk
https://www.thelakedistrict.org/
https://fellwalks.uk
https://www.wainwright.org.uk
https://www.walkingenglishman.com
http://www.wainwrightroutes.co.uk
https://www.wainwrightwalking.co.uk/

Key findings:
- The websites that included information on the Lake District, walking routes, fell walking advice and information about looking after the fells had very little information about Alfred Wainwright and the Wainwright Fells.
- The websites that provided information on Wainwright and the Wainwright fells didn’t give fell walking advice, information about looking after the fells or any general information about the Lake District. 
- Of the websites that did provide some information on Wainwright, some only gave lists or a map to show the Wainwright fells and no further information, some were more of a hobby/blog style site, and some didn’t load very well. ‘The Wainwright Society’ (wainwright.org.uk) was more about joining together as a community and community events and fundraising and didn’t provide any real information for someone new to walking the Wainwrights.
- During my research I found numerous websites that included a large variety of walking routes with a high level of detail provided.
- My experience as a user trying to gain all the required value from the user stories was not particularly positive. The main negatives were ease of navigation to find what I was looking for (due predominantly to size of site, but also missing navigation links with a need to scroll to find information) and the amount and detail of information presented. I found some of the websites overwhelming and off putting. I did however come across some designs that drew me in well as a user and one website that had great presentation, layout and organisation and made me feel instantly more at home to search through the site.

Conclusion:
1. A website that combines information about Wainwright and the Wainwright fells, with walking advice and information about looking after the fells, would have something unique to offer.
2. A website providing a high-level positive user experience, in order to quickly locate information about the Lake District fells plus advice on fell walking and walking routes, and/or information about Wainwright and the Wainwright fells, would stand out for the crowd.
3. While a number of sites do provide information on looking after the fells, this isn’t prominently placed and the information may therefore not be reaching users. The exception being https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/.
4. Details about walking routes in the Lake District are currently offered on numerous websites.

#### User Research

I created the following Google form which I then asked people who fell into both my primary and secondary target groups to complete.

<!-- Screenshots of survey to be included here -->

I received 9 responses to my survey covering the following target user groups:
- 1 x I have not been fell walking in the Lake District, but it is something I would be keen to try 
- 0 x I have done some fell walking in the Lake District and would like to do more. I have not heard the name ‘Wainwright’.
- 3 x I have done some fell walking in the Lake District and would like to do more. I have heard the name ‘Wainwright’ and the concept of 'The Wainwrights' and would like to learn more. 
- 5 x I know who Arthur Wainwright is and I am specifically looking to summit some/all of ‘The Wainwrights’. 

Findings:

<!-- Screenshot of summary for question 2 to be included here -->

When looking in more detail at the different reponses when grouped by user target groups I found:
- Those users who are specifically looking to summit some/all of 'The Wainwrights' had more required value within the scope of this survey (they all ticked more of the given options).
- A correlation between user groups and a desire to find out more about the 'Wainwright fells'. New to fell walking - no interest, Enjoy fell-walking and have heard of Wainwright - some interest Specifically looking to summit Wainwrights - High interest

The required values ticked by those specifically looking to summit Wainwrights:
-	4 x Walking routes (specifically walks that incorporate the Wainwrights)
-	3 x Information about ‘The Wainwright fells’ 
-	3 x Details specific to summiting the Wainwrights fells incl. tips and advice.
-	3 x Information on looking after the fells. Including reducing pollution, disturbance of flora and fauna and erosion of the landscape.
-	3 x Information about the geography, geology and history of the fells.
-	2 x Tips and stories from other fell walkers.
-	Information about Alfred Wainwright, who he was and his links to the Lake District fells.
-	More about the Lake District National Park and it’s fells.
-	Walking advice, such as what to wear, what to take, how to stay safe and tips for enjoying your walk to the full.

Conclusion:
This project will gel together much better as a whole if I change and narrow the primary target user group to just those specifically looking to summit Wainwrights. I will consider a secondary target user group of those who enjoy fell walking in the Lake District and might be looking to find out more about the Wainwright fells when designing the site but they will not be the main focus.
The results of this survey will be further used to inform the scope plane of development.

#### Overall Conclusion

My research findings (both competion and user) have led to an evolution of my target user group and a fine-tuning of the purpose of this website and the value for me as the owner. This can all be seen within the initial summary for the Strategy Plane.

### The Scope Plane

The scope for this project builds on the strategy plane and is heavily influenced by the results of my research (see [Competitor Reviews](#competitor-reviews) and [User Research](#user-research)). Time has been taken to fully explore the requirements of both user and owner, and how these could be met. 
Following an agile approach, the first sprint of this project will aim to keep time and other resources to a minimum whilst ensuring the project is vaible, providing enough value and an excellent user experience that will leave early users keen to return.

Some secondary navigation will also exist:
-	Key words on home page will link through to relevant sections.
-	Fell names on ‘The Fells’ page will link to the walk including them, should one exist. 

To support navigation:
-	The header will have an absolute position and always be visible.
-	The nav link for the page currently in will be visibly different to other links.
-	Links and interaction points clearly visible through consistent styling incl. using the hover pseudo selector.
-	Content will be hinted at where it continues outside of view through layout choices.

To support accessibility:
- Use of semantic html
- Secondary navigation to be clearly identifiable (both semantically and visibly)
- Clear headings throughout to support semantics and allow for navigation around the page.
- Clear groupings of information

## Project Construction

### Challenges

The challenges I came across during construction have been recorded below in the order which they occured.

| Problem/challenge encountered | Steps taken to overcome | Credit and acknowledgement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The heading ids I had added in order to set up my content links showed up in the README displayed on GitHub rather than staying hidden as shown when working in VScode. | Online search - No need to use heading ids as the specific heading could be targeted straight through the link - tested on two links - changed all links. | Solution found on [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links) |
| I wanted to create a drop down (I had seen elsewhere but didn't know what syntax to use) in order to include all my strategy plane research without my README becoming unwieldly. | Online search led me to the correct syntax to use. | Article [How to add Dropdown in Markdown ??](https://dev.to/asyraf/how-to-add-dropdown-in-markdown-o78) |
